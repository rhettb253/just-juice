# Just Juice

### Project By: Darran Holmes, Sheldon Pierce & Rhett Beardemphl

## Problem Domain 

Currently our business owner Octavio does not have a website for his company Just Juice. He would like his customers and prospective customers to be able to interact with them online so that the customers can understand who they are as a business and the services they provide. Octavio also wants his customers to be able to add his juices to a cart for later purchase. As well, he would like for his customers to be able to create their own juice blend. Our goal as a team is to  develop a website that showcases his juices and also allows the site visitor to add their juices to a cart for purchase.

## User Stories

- As a user I want to have a home page with a featured section displaying the top 3 juice options.

- As a user I want to have a buttons on the home page that lead to all the other pages on the website.

- As a user I want a page that displays a catalog of all juice options where the options are clickable and can add to the cart.

- As a user I want to have a page for the cart where all selected juices are added from the catalog and can also be removed.

- As a user I want the final page to be a create your own juice page. The page needs have a form to allow me to type in my name and pick the ingredients of the juice with a drop down menu and a submit button that adds the juice to the cart.

## Cooperation Plan

Our team is solid. We have Darran, he is a master at CSS3. He has never met a styling object he can't overcome. Then there is Sheldon, he is a JavaScript menace. He literally puts the Java in your script. Lastly we have Rhett, he is a talented manager. He will make sure everyone is at task all day long. He also enjoys tackling CSS and watching his adjustment decorate the document. Darran and Rhett have experience driving and navigating together. They will have no problems getting the website structured and styled. Sheldon will inject his JavaScript knowledge to store data locally and fire it to the page when needed. At this point, Rhett wants to develop greater strength in JavaScript's localStorage. Darran wants to derive a greater overall confidence in creating and understanding logical statements in JavaScript. Sheldon wants to understand algorithms better so he can make robots in the future. We plan to approach our day-to-day work by meeting up in the mornings and discussing what we achieved the day before and what we are going to attempt to achieve today. 

## Conflict Plan

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

We will make sure to vote on features we want to add and be open about our issue we may be having.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

We will make sure we discuss what our jobs are and make sure we hold each other accountable.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Sheldon is already ahead of Rhett and I on knownlege but he as always done a good job of explaining things and catching everyone else up.
